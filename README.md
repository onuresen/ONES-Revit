# ONES-Revit
Publish (demo) version of the Revit Addin

This is a simple publish page for the demo version of the Revit add-in which I developed for my work.
Original addin ONES has more than 50 tools, 3 different icon options and 3 language options. English, Japanese, and Turkish (ongoing)
Some of the functions are simple quick features (Override and select tools etc) while some of them are complicated and have bigger functions (Color Filter, Select Filter etc)

Add-in has developed only by myself over 3 years while using Revit full time in my job.
It's my dream to publish this add-in free to support Revit users all around the world.
However, I have copyright issues with my company because they decided to publish the add-in company-wide.
And even though I am the only developer and most of them are developed in my personal time, well I did use some work time as well.
Until I solve this copyright issue I would like to publish at least a few useful tools.
Please try it out and let me know for any feedback or questions.
